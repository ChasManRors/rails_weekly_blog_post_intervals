# rails_weekly_blog_post_intervals

Rails Weekly has not been updated in a while but as of now it is still possible it will be updated.

I focus on 11 Ruby on Rails blogs.

I wasn't sure if rails-weekly was still being updated.

App does a check to see if has been too long since the last blog post to Rails Weekly to be considered active.

Future:
  I can generalize to see if I should stop following some blogs
